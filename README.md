# Project_Rasa_Chatbot
Designed ChatBot, a contextual assistant using Rasa Framework and Python for Cab Booking. The given query is evaluated in terms of entities, then mapped to intents and the corresponding action is taken by ChatBot. A booking ID is provided when the user books a cab, which further can be used to update and cancel the booking.
